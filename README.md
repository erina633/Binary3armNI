# Binary3armNI: R codes for "Testing for Non-inferiority in Three-arm Trials with Binary Outcome: Novel Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches"

This research is supported by PCORI contract number ME-1409-21410, PI: Samiran Ghosh

The codes are provided to generate sample size and type I error for both Frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The following notations are used in this package:

• parE, parR, and parP: Binary proportion parameters for the arm E, R, and P, respectively

• nP: The sample size in the placebo arm (P)

• nR: The sample size in the reference arm (R)

• nE: The sample size in the experimental arm (E)

• theta: effect retention parameter

• r.alloc (or alloc): Allocation vector which can be (1:1:1), (2:2:1) or (3:2:1) for nE:nR:nP

• n: Total sample size

We give brief description of the R files below:
